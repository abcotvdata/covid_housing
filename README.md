Latest data files from Census Bureau's COVID Pulse Survey on housing, focused on likelihood of eviction or foreclosure. 

This data comes from a weekly 'pulse survey' being conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau of housholds across the country about their financial situation during the COVID-19 crisis. The surveys have been conducted since the pandemic's early months in 2020. The numbers are estimates and it is important to include the percentages as ranges that include the margin of error.

The data here show the number and percentage of adults surveyed who said they were "very likely" or "somewhat likely" to lose their current home to either eviction or foreclosure in the next two months because they are behind on rent or mortgage payments.

The tables include the number of people who said they were likely to face eviction or foreclosure, the percentage of people and the Census Bureau's estimate of the range of the margin of error for the survey.

The tables here are for Week 36, a period ending Sept. 2. We will replace with the latest data as it becomes available.

There is a version available as csv, which you can view, search or download here, and an Excel version, which you can download. There are also files available for the previous period, which was as of Aug. 16.
